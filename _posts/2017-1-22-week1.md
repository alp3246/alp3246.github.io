**What did you do this past week?**
This past week I attended lecture and read the articles assigned in class. I enjoy the way this class is run, especially having the intro quizzes at the start of class then calling on students from a list to answer questions. This process forces student participation and ensures that everyone has a feel for the material. However, the process could be improved by having the order of students called result from a script. This would reduce the time required to decide which student to call on and would allow the professor to eventually ask each student a question. 

**What's in your way?**
There are a few roadblocks that might cause students like myself to stumble. For example, I feel that the into quizzes could be improved on. The questions lack a level of comprehension that make it hard for students to understand the question in the brief time allotted. In addition, it would be helpful if the questions included a note about where in class was this discussed, i.e. lecture, book, articles. 

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I will continue to participate in class and hopefully be asked a question by the random name selection. During class when I have something to add it sometimes feels constraining that the names are chosen at random. Especially when the student called upon is floundering. 

**What's my experience of the class?**
So far I have practical experience in python and other languages as a software engineer. I have coded in Python, Java, Ruby, etc. at ARL, Pinecone, Chosen Software.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
Tip of the week - Use piazza! Not every class has this tool available and as soon as it is gone you are going to realize how much you missed it. Ask questions! Feel free to do so anonymously if you feel more comfortable. It is amazingly gratifying to wonder about a topic, formulate a question, and get multiple responses from students and TAs alike. It has helped me comprehend subject matter from computer architecture to logical arithmetic.
